# Ball and Paddle

This is the craziest ball and paddle game you have ever seen.

I originally wrote this game in 2015 autumn and my friends liked it. I
cleaned it up a bit, translated everything to English and set up this
repository for it.

## How to run it

Make sure you have Python 3.3 or newer with Tkinter and PyGame installed.
Then just run `ball-and-paddle.py` with your Python and everything should
work.

This project also uses easygui because I didn't feel like using anything
more complex for the non-pygame parts. Unfortunately the latest version of
easygui seems to be broken on Python 3, so I've included an old version of
easygui with this project. You need to have Tkinter installed because
EasyGUI uses it.

## WTF... ?

Yes, I said it's crazy.
